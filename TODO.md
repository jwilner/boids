# Things To Do

* Baby boids subscribe to mamma boids (via nonparking channel take!)
* Make it smooth --- velocity?
* Triangle instead of square

Somehow the behavior functions turn into behavior channels --- a higher
abstraction which would allow boids to update without having to know anything
else.
